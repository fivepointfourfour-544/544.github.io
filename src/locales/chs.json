At the first level, you will be able to see the number of digits in the enemy fleet statistics, with the second revealing the first digit in all three stats and each successive level will reveal the next digit.",
    "invade_desc": "Here, you can activate ships within your fleet and attempt to invade the faction' star system. You reputation with them affects how prepared they are to a possible invasion. The star system' fleet statistics take this into account already, so no extra calculation is needed. Invading has a bad effect on your reputation with the faction in question, reducing it by 10 for a successful invasion. However, due to their large ego, they take pity on failed attempts and reputation is not changed in the result of a loss.",

When Absorbing, you will lose 5 reputation in doing so, which is half the amount you would lose in an invasion.",
